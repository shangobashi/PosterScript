PosterScript
============
What is it?
-----------
PosterScript is an ensemble of automation scripts that facilitate the purchase of limited edition posters from popular websites such as MondoTees and others.
It is written in python and mainly uses the selenium module to automate the various browser tasks it needs to accomplish to successfully purchase a poster 
without the needing the user to manually refresh for hours.

Purpose
-------
PosterScript was strictly made for educational purposes and is not intended for commercial distribution
If you do use it for personal reasons, please use caution and follow the various websites' guidelines for purchase of their products.
I created this so I would be able to purchase the posters I wanted when I wasn't physically able to myself. Do not use this script to bypass
the purchasing limits set on posters, and use at your own risks. I am not responsible if you end up mistakenly purchasing a poster that you did not want.

Installation
------------
There is no installation process. Each script requires python 2.7, selenium and easygui to be installed on your system.
In addition, you will need the latest version of Mozilla Firefox with the plug-in Adblock+.
Included is a profile ("MOW") with the necessary .css and .jpg elements blocked.
