PosterScript
============

Enter your Mondo account info and let the script buy the poster for you !

This is version 1.9.1.

Includes a GUI interface to enter your account info and Gift card number and poster name.

Currently, there is a Var and a Reg Version, both of which serve a different purpose, depending if one wants the regular version of a poster (or if there is no variant), or the variant version of a poster.

Currently, only Gift Card payment in supported. This is done to prevent overbuys while running the script just for testing purposes, or while running multiple instances of the script. Credit Card support will be implemented in version 2.0

Version 2.0 will include CC support, Reg and Var support in one script, as well as a better and easier to use GUI. Coming soon !
